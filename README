PowerPlain - a plain-text presentation program.
-----------------------------------------------

What it is:

    Probably the best presentation program ever done.
    The output looks vastly superior to most other presentation
    programs.

    The source files are plain-text with just a little bit of
    syntax for headings and headers/footers.

    See example_presentation.pp for more.

You'll need:

    - Python
    - figlet <http://figlet.org>
    - a terminal with a big enough font

Usage:

    powerplain MODE FILE

To try it out, do:

    $ ./powerplain -i example_presentation.pp

    This starts the interactive mode (switch slides by pressing return).

The other modes are:

    -r  dumps rendered slides to stdout, seperated by a vertical tab
    -c  checks if the presentation overflows the boundaries
        (default is 60x20)
